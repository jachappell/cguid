The cguid Wordpress plugin appends the post's post date to its guid in
your site's rss feed. This can be useful if your site recycles existing
posts with new content and new post dates (e.g. Quote of the Day, This Day
in History, etc.).


== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done
this).
2. Put the 'cguid.php' file into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click
'Activate' for Custom GUID.
